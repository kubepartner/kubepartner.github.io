# Who am I?
KubePartner is a distributed operating system for cloud-native application management, using Kubernetes as its kernel. We ❤️ Open Source

# Where do I come from?
Its predecessor was KubeSphere, but due to its management's changes to the open-source license, removal of source code, and privatization, it inflicted significant damage on the open-source community and contravened the principles of open source. Therefore, in order to continue the spirit of open source, we have evolved from the previous version. To prevent potential commercial disputes, we now refer to ourselves as KubePartner, representing our commitment to always being a good partner of Kubernetes, growing alongside everyone, and making our modest contributions to the open-source community.

它的前生是KubeSphere，但是由于其管理着变更开源协议、删除源码和私有化，对开源社区造成了巨大伤害，也违背了开源精神。故为了继续延续开源精神，在旧版本上进行演化，并为了避免存在商业纠纷，我们现在称做KubeParter，代表永远是Kubenates的好伙伴，陪伴大家一起成长，为开源社区略尽绵薄之力。
